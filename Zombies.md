= 0. Before we Get Started =Before we can do anything with ReLogo, we need to make sure that we have a proper
installation of Repast Simphony 2.0. Instructions on downloading and installing Repast
Simphony on various platforms can be found on the Repast [Website](http://repast.sourceforge.net/).

# 1. Getting Started with ReLogo #

Now let us begin our exploration of ReLogo. We will be building a simple agent-based
model involving zombies chasing humans and humans running away from zombies. Our
approach will be to not overwhelm you but to explain only as much as is needed at each
step. By the end of this chapter, we'll have covered a lot of ground and you'll be able to
continue with your own explorations of ReLogo.
The rst thing we must do is create a new ReLogo project. This is done by clicking on
the New ReLogo Project icon in the toolbar (Fig. 1) at the top of our ReLogo workspace1.


This brings up the New ReLogo Project Wizard (Fig. 2) which gives us the ability
to name our project (and a few more options which we'll ignore for now). Typing in
\Zombies" in the \Project name" eld, we press the \Finish" button and the wizard sets
up our project. The project structure should look like Fig. 3 (but if it does not, see this
note2)
