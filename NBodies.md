# Introduction #

This model simulates any number of bodies interacting through gravity. It demonstrates the complexity that arises when more than two bodies interact. For example, compare the Wikipedia articles on the [Two-Body Problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-body_problem) with the [Three-Body](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem) one. It uses a Newtonian model of physics.

# How to Use #

First, generate two or more bodies. Use some of the controls listed below to change starting variables:
  * gravitational constant - control the gravitational constant G in the equation for determining the force between two massive objects
  * Number of Bodies - control the number of randomly generated bodies with mass
  * mass multiplier - control the constant with which to multiply all randomly generated masses
  * stationary super-massive object - if this checkbox is checked, the simulator will generate a sun-like object at the center of the simulation.
  * super-massive body's mass - control the mass of the central massive object

The simulator can display several different things during the simulation:
  * velocity: arrows indicate direction and the length of the arrow indicates speed.
  * center of mass of all bodies

# Things to Try #

What mass/G variables are most conducive to the formation of stable orbits around the central massive object?
