# 3. Output #

Model Outputter is also added. The added model outputter is comma separated values of "Time" and . One of the sample output file can be checked [here](https://code.google.com/p/cscs-repast-demos/source/browse/wiki/MothBasic/Model%20Output.txt)

**Note:**

  1. This Output can be fed into various external plug-ins available with RepastS like MATLAB and spreadsheet.
