#summary Rowan's stuff: current tasks, ideas, etc.
= Repast = 

Done: 
  * [Boids] in Java and ReLogo (though the tutorial is only for Java)   
  * [NBodies]
  * [SugarMarket]

=== Ideas ===
Here's a list of my ideas so far - will put in short descriptions later.
 * [Boids]: Agents follow simple rules which adjust their heading based on their neighbors' relative position and heading, and organic flocks emerge.
 * Two body or three body (see [NBodies])
 * simple traffic 
 * simple weather 
 * ant foraging
 * penguin huddle
 * simple morphogenesis
 * cellular automaton 

= Myself =
=== Intro === 
I'm an undergrad entering my final year at St. Mary's College of Maryland, a (secular) public liberal arts college. I'm doing my undergrad thesis on swarm robotics, and I'm planning on using RepastS for modelling purposes. I am also picking up an Art major for fun.
