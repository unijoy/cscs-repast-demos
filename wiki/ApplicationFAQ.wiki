Q: What skills are required?
 
<br>A:  Computer programming is required.  For 2011, the most  useful languages
to know are Java and Groovy, since most demo ABMs will be written using those.  
Using eclipse will be required, so  experience with Eclipse (and various addons like XML editors
and tools, EMF and GEF SDKs) is useful. Knowledge of Netlogo might be useful.
Experience with R, VisAD, Weka, Matlab, iReport, GridGain or Terracotta would be a plus.
Experience with JOGL and Java3D might be useful.

In addition, an ability and commitment to writing documentation is required,
including "introductory" documentation for the demo models  implemented.
The ABMs will be of little use as "demos" if new users cannot easily figure out what
they are and how to use them.

Q: Is a background in complex adaptive systems (CAS) research, and/or in
agent-based / individual-based computational modeling
required for this project?

<br>A. Knowledge of complex systems is not required, but for some
parts of the project that kind of experience would be helpful:

<ul>
<li>For writing demonstration models for RepastS, knowledge of CAS is not required but it would be useful. Certainly an interest in learning about CAS research would be important.</li>
<li>For working on Repast S itself, again knowledge of CAS is not necessary but it can be useful, so that the student has a feel for how Repast S is used, and thus what are features of interest to the RepastS intended user base.</li>
</ul>
