== Introduction ==

Hello, my name is Tim Sweda, and I am a PhD student at [http://www.northwestern.edu Northwestern University] in the [http://iems.northwestern.edu Department of Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences].  I currently work with [http://www.iems.northwestern.edu/people/faculty/detail.php?id=5a71e5b08169773801c6a6fd2ed974d3 Diego Klabjan] on a variety of decision making problems for electric vehicles.

During the summer of 2011, I participated in the [http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2011 Google Summer of Code] program and created several "demo" models for [http://repast.sourceforge.net Repast Simphony].  The project's homepage can be found [http://code.google.com/p/cscs-repast-demos/ here].  My mentor was [http://www.dis.anl.gov/staff/north.html Michael North] of [http://www.anl.gov Argonne National Laboratory].
