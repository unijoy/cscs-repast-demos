= Introduction =

This project was founded as part of a Google Summer of Code 2011 in order to improve [http://repast.sourceforge.net/ Repast Simphony]. We have two different goals:

  * Project #1: Create Agent Based Model _"Demos"_ using Repast Simphony
  * Project #2: Development of Repast Simphony

We hope to continue these projects throughout the year,
and as part of GSoC 2012 (should GSoC grant us support for interns again).
