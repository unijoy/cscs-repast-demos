=*Introduction*=

 
Hi, I am Mudit, I am a 7th semester student on Birla Institute of Technology and Science – Pilani studying at Goa Campus, I am simultaneously working for my Master’s degree in Chemistry and Bachelor’s degree in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering. 

I am interested in machine learning, swarm robotics, networked embedded systems and mobile Wireless Sensor Networks. I will be making “Demo” models on Repast S as a part of my GSoC 2011 project. I am looking forward to learn the basics of design and simulation of Agent Based Complex Systems as they are an integral part of mobile WSN and Swarm Robotics.

=*Tutorial*=

Although all models have detail documentation, but I also wrote a from-the-scratch tutorial of Follow The Leader Model. It has an introduction to relogo and multiagent modeling, detailed description of the code and how to analyse your model followed by future extension and references (with a lot of screen shots) and it can be found [https://code.google.com/p/cscs-repast-demos/wiki/followTheLeaderTutorial here]
