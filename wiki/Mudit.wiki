=*Introduction*=

 
I am a 6th semester student on Birla Institute of Technology and Science – Pilani studying at Goa Campus, I am simultaneously working for my Master’s degree in Chemistry and Bachelor’s degree in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering. 

I am interested in swarm robotics and embedded systems. A related field that interests me is Claytronics. It is about self-assembly of many modular robots to create synthetic reality. My recent work is centered on a new Wireless Sensor Network Platform and Mobile WSN. 

I will be making “Demo” models on the software as a part of my GSoC 2011 project. I am looking forward to learn the basics of design and simulation of complex systems and agent based complex systems as they are an integral part of mobile WSN and Swarm Robotics.
