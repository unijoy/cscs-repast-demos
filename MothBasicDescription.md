# 1. Before Getting Started #

Before trying to use the model, make sure that Repast Simphony is installed properly (version 2.0 Beta, released on 12/3/2010 or later) is available to use.

Instructions on downloading and installing Repast Simphony on various platforms can be found on the [Repast download website](http://repast.sourceforge.net/download.html).

RepastS models can be created with [Flowcharts](http://repast.sourceforge.net/docs/RepastFlowGettingStarted.pdf), a Logo-like language called [ReLogo](http://repast.sourceforge.net/docs/ReLogoGettingStarted.pdf), or purely in [Java and/or Groovy](http://repast.sourceforge.net/docs/RepastJavaGettingStarted.pdf), and even C++ with [Repast HPC](http://repast.sourceforge.net/docs/RepastHPCManual.pdf).

In this model, ReLogo was used to create the model. The documentations and other demo models on the same platform can be found [here](http://code.google.com/p/cscs-repast-demos/wiki/RepastSReLogo).

It is suggested that you go through the following models before this model, because the guiding algorithm is quite similar.

  1. BugCatcher
  1. Moth\_Advance
