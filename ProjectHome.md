# CSCS-Repast-Demos #

This site, cscs-repast-demos, is host to user-contributed open-source programs
that implement various agent-based models build using the
[Repast suite of software](http://repast.sourceforge.net), including Repast Simphony, Repast Simphony ReLogo and Repast for HPC.

The software from this site, cscs-repast-demos, is periodically checked and copies are placed in the "curated"  libarary of Repast models, at the [repast-demos](http://code.google.com/p/repast-demos/w/list) site.  The curators of repast-demos (e.g., core Repast Developers) check and tweak  the candidate models
to make sure that the look is consistent across each model page in the  [repast-demos](http://code.google.com/p/repast-demos/w/list) site,
that the models run with a specified version of Repast (currently Repast Simphony /ReLogo  2.0 and HPC 1.0.1)
and that they have some documentation. Within those bounds, the individual contributors are responsible for the content.

Both repast-demos and cscs-repast-demos sites were founded in 2011 with
[Google Summer of Code](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2011) support for student developers.
The wiki for this site contains wiki pages for those students and the programs, tutorials
and  other documentation they developed.  The programs they developed are available under downloads.  The Wiki for the project, including the results from GSoC 2011, can be found on the [cscs-repast-gsoc2011](.md) part of this site.

<h2>Google Summer of Code 2012</h2>

We have applied to be a [Google Summer of Code 2012](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2012) mentoring organization. Should we be selected and allocated some
internships, we will be looking for applications that address
our [Ideas for GSoC 2012](IdeasForGSoC2012.md) -- please see that page for details.

The students will be mentored by Repast Simphony developers and agent-based modelers at the <a href='http://cscs.umich.edu/'>Center for the Study of Complex Systems</a> at the <a href='http://www.umich.edu/'>University of Michigan</a> and at the <a href='http://www.cas.anl.gov/'>Center for Complex Adaptive Agent Systems Simulation</a> (CAS2) in the <a href='http://www.dis.anl.gov/'>Decision and Information Sciences Division</a> at <a href='http://www.anl.gov/'>Argonne National Laboratory</a>.

More information about Repast Simphony can be found in the <a href='http://repast.sourceforge.net/docs.html'>documentation pages</a>. The primary means of obtaining help with Repast is the Repast Interest <a href='https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/repast-interest'>mailing list and the list archives</a>.
