# General Information #

## Introduction ##

Hello, my name is Tim Sweda, and I am a PhD student at [Northwestern University](http://www.northwestern.edu) in the [Department of Industrial Engineering and Management Sciences](http://iems.northwestern.edu).  I currently work with [Diego Klabjan](http://www.iems.northwestern.edu/people/faculty/detail.php?id=5a71e5b08169773801c6a6fd2ed974d3) on a variety of decision making problems for electric vehicles.

During the summer of 2011, I participated in the [Google Summer of Code](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2011) program and created several "demo" models for [Repast Simphony](http://repast.sourceforge.net).  The project's homepage can be found [here](http://code.google.com/p/cscs-repast-demos/).  My mentor was [Michael North](http://www.dis.anl.gov/staff/north.html) of [Argonne National Laboratory](http://www.anl.gov).
