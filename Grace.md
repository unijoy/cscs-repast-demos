# General Information #

My name is Grace I. Lin, and I'm currently a second year PhD student in Computer Science from the University of California, Santa Cruz.  I work on tasks related to Natural Language Processing/Computational Linguistics.  I'm glad to finally get an opportunity to learn more about ABM and work on Repast!

On a more personal note, I love to travel and enjoy good food. I hope to explore a bit more of Santa Cruz (and northern California in general) through hiking this summer :]

# Completed (unverified) Models #

Learning and working on these models turned out to be more time-consuming than I had originally expected, but overall a good experience.  The completed, but unverified, models are listed as follow:

  1. **[Fire](Fire.md)**: spread of a fire through forest
    * [NetLogo: Earth Science: Fire](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/Fire)
  1. **[Termites](Termites.md)**: termites gather wood chips into piles
    * [NetLogo: Biology: Termites](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/Termites)
  1. **[Rebellion](Rebellion.md)**: rebel against a central authority
    * [NetLogo: Social Science: Rebellion](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/Rebellion)

# Planned Models #

Here's the remaining list of models of interest.  I hope to upload them as I work and finish them in the up coming months. I plan to work on them in the listed order, but that might be changed.

They are based on [NetLogo Models](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/index.cgi) and [Multiagent NetLogo Models](http://jmvidal.cse.sc.edu/netlogomas/) so I know what others have done, you know what to expect, and others know what to compare with. Well, I might add more/less features...

I've listed MORE models than expected in case there's overlap with other students. Each item is linked with the corresponding individual model. Let me know if there's any feedback on what (not) to do, etc.

  1. **Sunflower Biomorphs**: selective pressure
    * [NetLogo: Biology: Evolution: Sunflower Biomorphs](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/SunflowerBiomorphs)
  1. **Dining Philosopher**: does everyone get to eat?
    * [NetLogo: Computer Science: Dining Philosophers](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/DiningPhilosophers)
  1. **Turing Machine 2D**: information on a 2D tape
    * [NetLogo: Computer Science: Turing Machine 2D](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/TuringMachine2D)
  1. **Circle**: agents walk around in a circle (emergent behavior)
    * [Multiagent NetLogo Models: Circle](http://jmvidal.cse.sc.edu/netlogomas/circle/index.html)
  1. **Beernet**: The Beer Game
    * [Multiagent NetLogo Models: Beernet](http://jmvidal.cse.sc.edu/netlogomas/beernet/index.html)
  1. **Q-Learning**: path-finding algorithm
    * [Multiagent NetLogo Models: Q-Learning](http://jmvidal.cse.sc.edu/netlogomas/qlearning/index.html)
  1. **The Marriage Problem**: live happily ever after
    * [Multiagent NetLogo Models: The Marriage Problem](http://jmvidal.cse.sc.edu/netlogomas/marriage-problem/index.html)
  1. **Container Port Simulation**: best behavior for the crane operators
    * [Multiagent NetLogo Models: Container Port Simulation](http://jmvidal.cse.sc.edu/netlogomas/port/index.html)

That's all for now. Suggestions welcome.
